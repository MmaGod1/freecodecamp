# Tribute Page for Dr. Norman Borlaug

This project is a tribute page created for Dr. Norman Borlaug, the renowned agricultural scientist who is credited with saving over a billion people from hunger through his innovations in wheat breeding. The page showcases his achievements and life timeline through structured content and styled using CSS.

### The original page is found here:

- **CSS Layout**: Applied styles using CSS to control margins, padding, text alignment, and background colors to create an aesthetically pleasing layout.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensured that the image and text scale well on different screen sizes.
- **Typography**: Used font sizing and styling for better readability and emphasis on important text.
- **Image Styling**: Applied width and height control to ensure the image displays appropriately across all devices.
- **Link Styling**: Added custom styles to the link to enhance user interaction.
