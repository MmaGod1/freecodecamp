# My solution to freeCodeCamp's `Certificate Project`

## Reflection

I have completed **5 out of 5** projects for the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). I found the process very **interactive** and **enlightening**. It was both **fun** and **rewarding** to go through each project and see my progress.

## What I Learned

- Writing semantic HTML
- Styling with Flexbox and Grid
- Creating responsive layouts
- Using media queries
- Improving visual hierarchy and spacing

---

## What Iâ€™m Still Working On

- How to scale font sizes and elements based on the device screen
- Mastering CSS Grid
- Creating and transforming animations smoothly

---

## What's Next?

I hope to continue learning independently by **building personal projects** and improving my skills. These will eventually go into my portfolio page.
