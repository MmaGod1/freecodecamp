# Technical Documentation Page

This project is a technical documentation page inspired by the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification project. It provides documentation content for JavaScript and Java, structured into clear sections with a responsive layout.

### The original page can be found here:  
[https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks/#JavaScript_and_Java](https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks/#JavaScript_and_Java)

## Project Overview

The technical documentation page includes the following key features:

- **Navigation Sidebar**: A vertical menu listing topics in the documentation, allowing users to jump to different sections.
- **Main Content Area**: Detailed documentation on JavaScript and Java, organized with headings, paragraphs, and code examples.
- **Responsive Layout**: Designed to adapt to various screen sizes for better readability and usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

## What I Learned

- **Flexbox Layout**: Styled the initial version of the page using Flexbox to achieve a responsive and structured layout.
- **Positioning Techniques**: In a second version of the page, I implemented layout using positioning properties to experiment with different styling approaches.
- **Navigation and Linking**: Implemented internal linking using `id` attributes and anchor tags for smooth navigation between sections.

## Files

- [index.html](index.html) – Main version styled with Flexbox  
- [styles.css](styles.css) – Styles for the Flexbox version  
- [index2.html](index2.html) – Alternate version styled with positioning  
- [styles2.css](styles2.css) – Styles for the positioning version

## Installation

To view the project locally:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open [`index.html`](index.html) in your browser to view the Flexbox version.
3. Open [`index2.html`](index2.html) in your browser to view the positioning version.

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of semantic HTML, practice both Flexbox and CSS positioning for layout, and experiment with creating accessible and responsive technical documentation.
