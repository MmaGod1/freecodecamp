# Portfolio Project

This is a responsive personal portfolio webpage built with **HTML** and **CSS**. It showcases some demo projects and contact information with a clean, accessible layout.


### Credits
This project is a clone of the original **Responsive Web Design Certification Project** on [freeCodeCamp](https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks/).

It was built as part of my learning journey using **HTML** and **CSS**.


### Links to each files

- [index.html](./index.html) – The main HTML file.
- [styles.css](./styles.css) – The stylesheet with variables, grid, media queries, and more.


## What I Learned and Applied

- **CSS Variables**: Defined and reused consistent color values across the project.
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: Structured the layout and created a responsive project gallery.
- **Media Queries**: Adjusted layout and design from a base screen size of 768px and upwards.
- **Font Scaling**: Used relative units like `rem` for better responsiveness and accessibility.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Added smooth scrolling behavior when navigation links are clicked.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the site looks good on different devices and screen sizes.
