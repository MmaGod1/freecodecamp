# Survey Form Project

In this project, I built a survey form that collects user data and feedback. It includes various form elements such as text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and a textarea. The form is styled with CSS to be visually appealing and user-friendly.

## What I learned to do in this project:

1. **Responsive Form Design**: 
   - Used flexible layout techniques like **flexbox** and **media queries** to create a responsive and visually appealing form.

2. **Styling Form Elements**: 
   - Styled various form elements such as inputs, textareas, selects, and radio buttons. Specifically, customized their sizes, appearance, and interaction states (e.g., `:focus`).

3. **Background Styling**: 
   - Applied a full-screen background image using `background: url(...)` and managed its properties like `background-size`, `background-position`, and `background-repeat` to make the page visually appealing.

4. **Font Styling**: 
   - Incorporated web fonts (from Google Fonts) to style text with **Lora** font family for a professional, readable appearance.

5. **Fieldset and Label Styling**: 
   - Enhanced the appearance and usability of the form by using **fieldset** and **label** elements, customizing the layout with flexbox, and adding spacing and padding.

6. **Customizing Checkboxes and Radio Buttons**: 
   - Used the `.inline` class to style checkboxes and radio buttons, making them more user-friendly and visually consistent with the design.

7. **Improved Accessibility**: 
   - Ensured better accessibility by using **`<label>`** elements and ensuring inputs are linked with their respective labels, improving the usability of the form.

8. **Pseudo-Classes**: 
   - Styled form elements using pseudo-classes like `:focus` to highlight inputs when they are focused, providing a clear visual cue to users.

9. **Styling for Submitting Forms**: 
   - Custom styled the submit button (`input[type="submit"]`) with colors, margins, and hover effects to make it stand out and enhance user interaction.

10. **Used Overlay for Background Effect**: 
    - Created a subtle overlay effect over the background image using `::before` to improve the contrast between the text and background, improving legibility.

11. **Semantic HTML**: 
    - Ensured that semantic HTML tags were used correctly, like `fieldset` for grouping related form elements and using `h1` for the title, making the structure more meaningful and easier to navigate for both users and search engines.

## Conclusion

This project enhanced my skills in building accessible and responsive web forms, while also ensuring a great user experience through thoughtful design and functionality.
